# FoodOrderingProject

## This project was made with Java Programming Language, with the SWING Toolkit used to create the UI for the project.
## The project uses h2 databases to store data.

The project is a simple prototype of a Food Ordering Application, simulating a PokeBowl restaurant ordering system.
Users are able to customize their food order via pre-set options in the application. The details of the order would be displayed
as a summary during checkout before being stored in the database.
A receipt can be printed in the console if selected by the user.

Several commands are able to be inputted in the console in order to Read or Delete the order records within the database.
